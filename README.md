# Gamebots.ai

## Overview
A game system for battling your coworkers on slack.

Built with Botkit and deployed with [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/overview) to get the scoop on the the Beep Boop hosting platform. The Slack API documentation can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/).

### Run locally
	npm install
	SLACK_TOKEN=<YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN> npm start

Things are looking good if the console prints something like:

    ** API CALL: https://slack.com/api/rtm.start
    ** BOT ID:  witty  ...attempting to connect to RTM!
    ** API CALL: https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage

### Run in BeepBoop
If you have linked your local repo with the Beep Boop service (check [here](https://beepboophq.com/0_o/my-projects)), changes pushed to the remote master branch will automatically deploy.
